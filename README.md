# Cardio-Vascular-Disease-analysis
Prediction CVD in patients
This is my small pet-project about cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients of different ages using 12 features. “Cardio” is the target feature.  
Preliminarily, I cleaned the data and got rid of outliers.
Then I made some visualizations and tested a few hypotheses.
Further I compared 3 classifiers: RandomForest, XGBoost and LightGBM without tuning.
XGBoost showed the best result.
In the end, I made visualization with showing the most important features for the each of above classifiers.
Your feedback is welcome to me.
